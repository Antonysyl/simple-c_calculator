# simple-c_calculator
building a simple c calculator which can later be used as an open source project for those who wants to practice and build their C  programming language skill

This calculator is being simplified by ME the best way i can. 

16-10-2022 being the day of creation, i am still working and advancing as a Software Engineering Student On ALX.

The sole purpose of creating this calculator is to help myself get better in programming and every other SE student out there who wants to use this as an open source project for both educational purpose and personal contributions are free to.
